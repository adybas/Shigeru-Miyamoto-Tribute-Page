<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto" target="_blank">Shigeru Miyamoto </a>(Japanese: 宮本 茂 Hepburn: Miyamoto Shigeru, born November 16, 1952) (pronounced [mijamoto ɕiɡeɾɯ]) is a Japanese video game designer and producer, currently serving as the co-Representative Director of Nintendo. He is best known as the creator of some of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling video games and franchises of all time, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, F-Zero, Donkey Kong and Pikmin.</p>
<p>Miyamoto originally joined Nintendo in 1977, when the company was beginning its foray into video games, and starting to abandon the playing cards it had made since 1889. His games have been prominently showcased and widely anticipated as flagship titles of every Nintendo video game console, with his earliest work appearing on arcade machines in the late 1970s. He managed Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development software division, which developed many of the company's first-party titles. As a result of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's death in July 2015, Miyamoto fulfilled the role of acting Representative Director, alongside Genyo Takeda, until being formally appointed as the company's "Creative Fellow" a few months later.</p>
